Docs:
* High-level architecture overview
* Usage documentation
* GTP interface documentation

Base:
* Further optimize board implementation, oprofile fun
* Clean up GTP interface, allow custom GTP commands for
  modules

Playouts:
* Mercy rule
* Separate prior-hinting class
* Separate parameters for playout module
* Split playout aspects to custom-stackable pieces
* Possibly replay top-rated unplayed moves from the tree
  in the playout?

UCT:
* Resync threads periodically
* Ponder mode
* In S.D., stop reading early if result cannot change
* Time controls infrastructure

UCB1AMAF:
* Fix RAVE for good (still much weaker than light fuego)
* Optimize the tree walk
* Agressive AMAF counting: "if opponent got a stone here,
  count that as a !result for my stone play" ?
* Separate constants for prior and amaf elements
