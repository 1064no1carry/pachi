Docs:
* Manual page - full usage documentation
* GTP interface documentation

Base:
* Further optimize board implementation, oprofile fun
* Clean up GTP interface, allow custom GTP commands for modules
* Implement parameter setup over GTP
* gogui-friendly GTP interface

General improvements:
* Opening book
* Criticality
	Further use in search. Experiment with crit_min_playouts adaptively
	adjusting based on number of simulations so far.
* Killer moves
* MM local-based patterns
* Balanced local-based patterns?
* Local tree forcing

Playouts:
* Split playout aspects to custom-stackable pieces
* Possibly replay top-rated unplayed moves from the tree
  in the playout?

UCB1AMAF:
* Fix RAVE for good (still noticeably weaker than fuego?)
* Separate constants for prior and amaf elements?
