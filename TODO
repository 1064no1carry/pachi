Docs:
* Manual page - full usage documentation
* GTP interface documentation

Base:
* Further optimize board implementation, profiling fun
* Clean up GTP interface, allow custom GTP commands for modules
* gogui-friendly GTP interface
* Implement parameter setup over GTP (less important)
* Fix the build system to allow fully parallel build
	However, revamp to something like cmake (or, ugh, autotools)
	is not guaranteed to be appreciated.

Self-contained tasks:
* Try to disable the bsize pattern feature
	It just fudges the pattern evaluation since for most tactical
	patterns fourth line vs. fifth line just doesn't matter. Maybe
	its max should be 2 and maybe it should just be gone, needs
	regenerating the pattern database and benchmarking.
* Develop dedicated playout handling for few common tactical situations
	Monkey jump (and its followup sequences!), bent four in the
	corner, ...
* Fix seki recognition to be stable
	Try to research and fix most cases harmed by selfatarirate=100
	or find another way to fix seki.
* Try to avoid using a hash table for 3x3 patterns
	Instead autogenerate procedural matching code; may be more
	efficient (the near-guaranteed L1 cache miss is fairly expensive).
* Optimizing our tree implementation for cache-efficiency
	Statistics of all children of a parent node shall be contained
	in an array of the parent node so that move evaluation during
	the descent can access them sequentially in memory, instead
	of walking a linked list. Pasky already tried once but it's
	somewhat arduous and dull work.
* Clean up the is_private() hack in the distributed engine
	We should simply check against a proper IP range ACL specified
	as a parameter instead.

General improvements:
* Automated building of opening book
* Expanding and tagging the regression suite
	Even better, create a nice UI for our users to contribute and
	crowdsource!
* Implement Pachi support to fishtest
	http://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests would allow crowdsourcing
	Pachi parameter tuning.
* Split playout aspects to custom-stackable pieces?
* Port to Intel Phi (if we get the hardware :)

Some heuristics to test:
* Local trees (work in progress, no luck so far)
* Liberty maps (work in progress)
* Implement a tsumego solver and apply it once per playout (stv insp.,
  see Eric van der Werf's PhD thesis?)
* MM local-based patterns in playouts (work in progress, no luck so far)
* Balanced local-based patterns?
* Killer moves (redundant to RAVE?)
* Reverse status learning
	Run on game corpus. Start at final position, watch development
	of status of all stones. The moment the final status and expected
	status changes, analyze, especially if move choice differs. Use
	learnt status-fixing moves in simulations somehow.
	Tried to do this on Pachi-played games; no measurable effect
	(maybe too small sample).
