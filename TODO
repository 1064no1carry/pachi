Docs:
* Manual page - full usage documentation
* GTP interface documentation

Base:
* Further optimize board implementation, oprofile fun
* Clean up GTP interface, allow custom GTP commands for
  modules
* Implement parameter setup over GTP
* gogui-friendly GTP interface

Patterns:
* Heavy optimization work
* Analyze feasibility of various possible features
* Use pattern3-type patterns for incremental board spatials matching
  (should be much faster, and also usable for Moggy policy)

Playouts:
* Finish the ELO-play policy
* Mercy rule?
* Split playout aspects to custom-stackable pieces
* Possibly replay top-rated unplayed moves from the tree
  in the playout?

UCT:
* Ponder mode
* Time controls infrastructure
* Outside of japanese byoyomi, stop reading early if result cannot change
* Support for different default settings for various board sizes
* Support for prior hinting based by custom externally linked
  evaluation function
* Support for different float types when running with huge playout counts

UCB1AMAF:
* Fix RAVE for good (still noticeably weaker than fuego?)
* Separate constants for prior and amaf elements?
