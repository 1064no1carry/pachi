ZZGo is a simple modular framework for robots playing the game of
Go/Weiqi/Baduk. The aim is to make it easy to plug your engine
to the common infrastructure and implement your ideas while
minimalizing the overhead of implementing the GTP, board tools, etc.

ZZGo is under the BSD licence (close to public domain) so that as
many people as possible can use it. Some of the bundled engines
might be under a more restrictive licence (GPL).
