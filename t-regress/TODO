A list of games to put in the regression suite.

This list can be processed automatically:

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/6/6/tyzef-pachi30s.sgf ladder
  pachi tries to run away from a losing ladder against a 7k in even
  game. The 7k, disgusted, passed then resigned.

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/6/5/pachi2-SimpleBot.sgf ladder
  pachi shouldn't play the broken ladders up to move 53

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/6/5/Zen19-pachi2.sgf semeai falseeye
  should have won
 . move 185 S15 very dubious

 . move 211 T18 pachi still thinks the semeai is undecided.
   but white has a lot more liberties. How can the playouts
   not see this?

 . move 227 S3: here are suggestions by Aja
    If a false will become a real eye by capturing a diagonal group,
    then capture the group instead of filling the false eye. So if
    pachi wants to fill s3 it will capture at T1 instead. Then S3
    will become an illegal move so pachi will evaluate this group
    100% alive and won't play at T2 such stupid move.

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/6/5/tazaki-pachi30s.sgf semeai falseeye
  pachi doesn't see even one move ahead in a semeai, it expects
  an answer outside the semeai. The score drops from 0.625 to 0.337:

  move 194:
    [880000] best 0.624794 komi 0.4 | seq L19 G12 F11 P11 | can L19(0.625)
O19(0.623) N19(0.469) P11(0.523)
    FINEST: Got successful response to command "genmove b": = L19
    FINEST: Got successful response to command "play w j16": =
  move 196:
    FINEST: Queued command sent to engine: genmove b
    [1026644] best 0.336825 komi 0.2 | seq P11  T8  R3  M9 | can P11(0.337)
O11(0.336) O19(0.334) N19(0.340)
    FINEST: Got successful response to command "genmove b": = P11

  The game was lost already but pachi should have known this before.

  move 244: T13 doesn't make sense. This is due to wrong estimate of
  white's right group:
    [1922010] best 0.492722 | seq T13  T4  D5  M6 | can T13(0.493)
S18(0.493)  L4(0.493)  E6(0.491)
    FINEST: Got successful response to command "genmove b": = T13

  At move 282 pachi still thinks white's group is undecided.
  We must find a way of not filling the S7 eye in the playouts.

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/5/29/snowmen-pachi2.sgf
    169 B5 seems to be the losing move. This move doesn't make sense.
  Pachi has been wrongly evaluating both bottom group around S4 (it's just
  hairy for simulations) and top group around A19 - that one is a bit more
  interesting, the problem is that black is double likely to play E19
  (since it's C19 selfatari cousin), but after E19, white will not notice
  the need to connect at C19. Not sure how to solve this yet, perhaps some
  way to add cousins to last_move logic...

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/5/28/pachi2-Rubel.sgf
    won game lost: 212 H13 should be at J12.

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/5/27/ManyFaces1-pachi2.sgf
   had won game, move 135 F1 very bad. at end doesn't see ko at t7. (b t10
kills above)

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/5/23/pachi2-ManyFaces1.sgf
  leading up to 90% then lost.
  bad evaluation of 3 areas according to pasky.

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/5/25/pachi2-Zen19S.sgf
  lost but was leading according to ajahuang and Zen itself

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/2/20/ramesses2-pachi2.sgf
  good example of losing a won game.

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/1/11/llopl-pachi2.sgf ladder
  terrible ladder bug

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2010/12/5/pachi-CzechBot.sgf
  big mistake at F9 didn't see snapback. Pasky comments:
    The "does not seen snapback" bug is nasty.  The problem is that
    there is also a "global capture heuristic" if there're no fun
    local moves, it looks for groups to capture and if white tenukis
    and does not capture immediately, this heuristic kicks in.  But
    there is no "global atari heuristic" that would drive black
    similarly to play at F1 and create the snapback if I test with
    playout=moggy:capturerate=0, it reliably destroys the snapback
    i.e. with capturerate=90, white is much more likely to come back
    to the situation later even when playing tenuki first.

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/1/15/pachi2-rollingon.sgf semeai
  big semeai with easy counting of liberties misjuged
  move 169 0.7322 -> move 171  0.2600

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/2/18/pachi2-tf-3.sgf seki
  lost because of unrecognized seki

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/6/9/botkiller2-pachi30s.sgf falseeye
  threw away a won game. pachi thought until the end that top left
  white group was dead, so it made silly moves elsewhere.
  The playouts must be prevented from filling the eye at A17.

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/6/10/pachi30s-samba-2.sgf falseeye
  exactly the same problem as botkiller2-pachi30s.sgf:
  pachi considers the top left black group as unsettled
  although it is clearly alive. So it makes silly moves
  elsewhere. We have to fix this bug, it is too frequent.

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/6/9/jinen-pachi30s-2.sgf ko
  move 165 G5 again playing the ko threat before the ko.
  move 187 R18 is not a ko threat
  move 215:
    At this point pachi still considers the top right as
    unsetled, although it is is clearly lost for B. So pachi's
    estimate of winning by 61% is way too optimistic.

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/6/14/pachi2-Regenbogen.sgf
  pachi doesn't see that bent four in top left corner is dead.
  Still thinks it is winning 79% at move 250 G4.

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/6/14/pachi2-cdocdo-3.sgf semeai
  pachi loses every semai by a large number of liberties
  but still considers itself winning 57% up to move 222 G16.

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/6/13/pachi30s-Jep.sgf ladder
  moves 102..108 playing a broken ladder

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/6/18/dorabon-pachi2-4.sgf semeai falseeye
  pachi considers the bottom left semeai won by black (but black
  loses it) and the bottom right as undecided (white is clearly
  alive). At move 270 L4 it still thinks it is leading by 80%
  although the game is lost.
  The bottom right is the same problem as
  http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/6/10/pachi30s-samba-2.sgf
  and http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/6/9/botkiller2-pachi30s.sgf
  This corner shape is very frequent and pachi always gets it wrong.

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/6/18/pachi2-ultimakang-4.sgf
  pachi was winning up to move 230 Q14 big mistake. Win ratio dropped
  from 60% to 25% at next move.

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/6/18/akkannbee-pachi2.sgf seki
  pachi totally confused by very simple seki.

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/7/6/xiaosugi-pachi2.sgf seki
  pachi thinks until the end that it wins by 80% because it
  doesn't understand the seki in lower right. It should have lost
  by 42.5 points but white mistakenly agreed to treat the seki as dead.

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/7/5/pachi2-azlan7-2.sgf
  move 84 E10 & 86 F10 big mistakes, leave white group dead.
  (amazingly pachi recovered and azlan7 escaped in the end).

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/7/5/fafahhhh-pachi2.sgf
  threw away won game, probably because of complex corner situations
  won by time but game was lost on board

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/7/3/pachi2-oasis7.sgf
  Passed even though a dead opponent group was marked alive.

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/7/28/pachi2-Novicer.sgf falseeye
  Pachi makes many stupid moves because it thinks the top left
  corner is unsettled although it is clearly alive. This shape
  (4 in a row) is so simple that it should get it right.
  W 252 S11 bad
  W 256 T12 bad
  W 264 E19 doesn't make sense, but still 69%
  W 266 H19 doesn't make sense, but still 61%
  W 268 T9 should be T8
  W 292 A17 50%, W 294 R6 37% shows that top left was not
    evaluated correctly.
  Also false eye evaluation problem in bottom left.

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/7/28/pachi2-pkunzip-2.sgf ladder
  W 132 C9, W 134 B8, W 136 A8 plays a broken ladder but win ratio 52%
  so it should not play desperate moves.
  Pachi thought it was winning 72% at W 198 M3 but lost the game.

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/7/16/ihatebots-pachi2.sgf semeai
  pachi threw away the game because it didn't evaluate the
  semeai in bottom left correctly.

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/7/31/pachi2-Drogba987.sgf
  B 28 H4 should be at F1 or G1 to save E2 & E3 and the game.
  Pachi usually finds this so I'm surprised it didn't get it here.

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/8/9/pachi2-BlueSpark.sgf ladder
  move 150 R19: pachi extends a losing ladder

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/8/8/Dallas-pachi2-2.sgf ladder
  move 121 L19: pachi extends a losing ladder

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/8/9/somrak-pachi2-2.sgf ladder
  move 143 N19: pachi extends a losing ladder
  This ladder bug seems more frequent since e9df2b6 (even though
  this change made Pachi 40 elo stronger).

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/8/10/jerryfish-pachi2.sgf semeai
  lost even game against 3k. Win ratio drops from 61% at 117 N1
  to 49% at the next move. So pachi didn't evaluate the semai correctly.

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/8/12/xiaosugi-pachi2.sgf falseeye
  Pachi hallucinated again on bottom right corner.
  This is the same problem as
    http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/6/18/dorabon-pachi2-4.sgf
    http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/6/10/pachi30s-samba-2.sgf
    http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/6/9/botkiller2-pachi30s.sgf
  This corner shape is very frequent and pachi always gets it wrong.

* http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/8/24/StoneGrid-pachi2.sgf ladder
  Move 51 onwards: pachi plays a broken ladder, which almost cost the game.
  This might be the same bug as
    http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/8/9/somrak-pachi2-2.sgf

  just the game but also the first place in the tournament.
