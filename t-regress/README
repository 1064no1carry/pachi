This is Pachi's regression suite. It contains SGF game records that can
be automatically probed with current Pachi version for particular
behavior (usually observed in older Pachi versions). We do not anticipate
that Pachi would pass all of the tests - when it will, it will be probably
pro strength. ;-) The goal is simply to steadily reduce these and verify
that modifications do not reintroduce bad behavior.

The game SGF records are in the games/ subdirectory, and also cross-linked
in by-*/ subdirectories based on categories. Each SGF record must contain
a GC[] tag ("game comment") describing the test-case in a manner that is
both human-readable and machine-readable. The description lists specific
moves and how they should be tested, one move per line, using this syntax:

	<movenumber>@<movepos> <classification>[,<classification>,...] <comment>

	movenumber: Number of the tested move
	movepos: The original move coordinate (just for consistency)
	classification: Comma-separated list of move classifications,
			no whitespaces
	comment: Ignored by the testsuite.

These classifications are available:

	bad	This move should not be chosen as the next move.
	bad!	This move is so useless that it should not be in the top
		considered moves. (This is a bit feeble class.)
